# Unrivaled
This mod adds heroes from the hero shooter Marvel Rivals into Balatro! The aim is to somewhat maintain the relative balance of Vanilla Balatro(one could consider the aim of this mod to be a Vanilla+/Vanilla++ mod) while raising the potential power ceiling by adding heroes as jokers with abilities inspired by their kits, designs and/or lore!  
  
In general, most Heroic Jokers will have powerful effects that are more conditional than many of the vanilla Jokers, granting situationally stronger effects and more scoring options in exchange for heavier restrictions and costs in comparison.

Special thanks to ScarletFox1 and Poncho8a for playing a major part in the design and playtesting process.
