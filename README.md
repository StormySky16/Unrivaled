# Unrivaled
This mod adds heroes from the hero shooter Marvel Rivals into Balatro! The aim is to maintain the relative balance of Vanilla Balatro while raising the potential power ceiling by adding heroes as jokers with abilities inspired by their kits and/or lore!  
In general, most Heroic Jokers will have powerful effects that are more conditional than many of the vanilla Jokers, granting stronger effects and more scoring options at the cost of heavier restrictions and costs.
